It is often associated with people working in low-wage jobs where they are paid very little and have few other options. To avoid modern slavery, young people can focus on developing specific knowledge, taking on accountability, and leveraging their skills. \n",

This knowledge can be acquired through reading, engaging in activities you enjoy, and cultivating your intellectual obsessions. \n",
